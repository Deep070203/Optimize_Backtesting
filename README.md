# Optimize_Backtesting

In this project, I learned about optimizng a backtesting trading strategy in python. <br />
The trading strategy used here is "Bollinger Band Strategy" which uses the bollinger bands to buy and sell stock. <br />

Used important libraries:

numpy <br />
pandas <br />
yfinance <br />
datetime <br />
matplotlib.pyplot - to plot the returns <br />
pyfolio - to create a tear sheet <br />
